Interaction and Presentation Options
Description: 
First, users would be asked to choose the mode of search or visualization.

If they choose the search mode, users could search a specific state covid data or county covid data. The result would be showed in table view using prettytable module.

If they choose the visualization mode, they could choose the visualization of state or county. If they choose the state, they have three state visualization presentations to get: covid map, bar graph, vaccination relation graph. Otherwise, they have two county visualization presentations to get: cases and mask use relation graph, historical cases line chart.
